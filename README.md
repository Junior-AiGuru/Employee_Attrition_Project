## **Key Challenges:**
-     High-Dimensional Feature Space :
The dataset contained a high number of features(30+).
This "Curse Of Dimensionality" risked:
  
- High computational complexity
- Model overfitting
 <hr>

-     Unbalanced Data :
The target variable (Attrition) showed severe imbalance (83:17), leading to :
-  Biased model evaluation
-  Models favoring the majority class
-  Reduced sensitivity to attrition patterns
  <hr>
  
-     Outlier Detection and Treatment :
Few numerical features contained extreme outliers that threatened model integrity by:
 
- Distorting feature scaling/normalization
- Potentially representing data entry errors or rare edge cases

  <hr>

## **Next Steps:**

- Expand feature set with employee engagement metrics

- Implement A/B testing framework for HR interventions

- Develop automated retraining pipeline
